# SOLID Principles in Python

## S - Single Responsibility Principle
## O - Open/Closed Principle
## L - Liskov Substitution Principle
## I - Interface Segregation Principle
## D - Dependency Inversion Principle

Here's a brief explanation of each principle and how they can be applied in Python code:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should focus on doing one thing well.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. In Python, this means that subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes without causing errors or unexpected behavior.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Instead of having big, general-purpose interfaces, it's better to have smaller, more specific ones.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This promotes loose coupling and makes code more flexible.

Here's a simple Python code example that demonstrates the SOLID principles:
